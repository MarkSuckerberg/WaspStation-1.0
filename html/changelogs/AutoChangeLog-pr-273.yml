changes:
  - rscadd: Security officers and Wardens have a taser again! The HoS just has his
      special gun as usual.
  - rscadd: Cargo can now order tasers again! For 4000 points for two!
  - balance: Tasers are no longer an instant spessman go horizontal, and should act
      more like stunbatons.
