changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a status tab display for stored alcohol.
  - tweak: Substantially buffs regen for having 400+ stored alcohol. Ultimately still
      more useful for recovery than confrontation.
  - tweak: Greatly lowers the toxin damage per cycle for alcohol deprivation. Was
      10, now 2.5
