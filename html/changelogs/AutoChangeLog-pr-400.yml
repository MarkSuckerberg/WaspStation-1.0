changes:
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes now have realtime directional audio, complete with occlusion
      when you're far away or behind a wall.
  - rscadd: More than one jukebox can play a song at a time now. Have up to 5 jukeboxes
      playing at once!
  - rscadd: Devs can now control the wet and dry channels of sounds played via playsound_local.
      The new envwet and envdry arguments will control the volume of the wet and dry
      track, respectively.
  - code_imp: Jukeboxes have been turned into a subsystem. Track initialization, audio
      playing, etc, are now handled via SSJukeboxes instead of via the jukebox object
      procs.
  - config: Jukebox tracks now require an additional ID field at the end of their
      name. This will make it easier to add jukebox-style objects that are only capable
      of playing specific songs, without worrying about copyright issues.
  - balance: The jukebox now falls off over a greater distance. You can now actually
      hear the jukebox while sitting in a far corner of the bar, or while passing
      through the main hallways.
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now properly remove themselves from the active jukebox list
      when destroyed
  - tweak: Jukeboxes now have 6 audio channels available to them, up from the previous
      accidental 2 and previously intended 5 channels.
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now work again on clients running versions higher than 512.1459.
  - bugfix: People will no longer have their ears consumed by an eldritch god if multiple
      jukeboxes are active and the first jukebox in the jukebox list stops playing,
      then tries to play again
  - tweak: Instead of the debug text for invalid jukebox behavior being printed to
      world, the debug text is now restricted to the runtime panel.
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes can be purchased from Cargo for $35,000. By Ignari-Coldstorm
  - balance: More jobs can now interact with the Jukebox's playlist! Kitchen, Botany,
      Cargo, Engineering, and Theater access can now modify the jukebox instead of
      just bartender access. By Ignari-Coldstorm
