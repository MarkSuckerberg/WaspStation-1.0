  - balance: The Head of Security's X-01 energy gun has had its ion bolt lens reshaped
      slightly, allowing for far more efficiency in projecting ion bolts. It is now
      capable of firing up to 10 ion bolts before needing to recharge.
  - balance: The Head of Security's energy gun has additionally had a fourth lens
      added to its optics array, allowing for the firing of taser electrodes.
